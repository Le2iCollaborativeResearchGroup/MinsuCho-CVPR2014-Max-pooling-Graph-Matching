# Graphical Abstract

---------------------------

1. Problem: feature matching using graph structure
	- Graph construction: features (graph nodes), connections (graph edges), distances (graph weights).
	- Affinity between graph nodes.
	- Affinity between graph edges.
	- Optimization of quadratic form.

2. Motivation:
	- Feature matching considering both local and global information.
	- Robust to outliers by considering geometric structures.

3. Algorithms:
	- Max-pooling.
	- Reweighted Random Walk.
	- Fractorization.

4. Application:
	- feature matching	
	- object recognition

# Discussions

---------------------------

1. 
2. Add a smoothness constraint in the pose determination? 
since the method is real time, assuming the head is detected in each consecutive frame, the pose should vary smoothly i.e. have a smooth transition between frames. If the video is observed, around the 1:05 mark, the normal vectors jumps. This is because the computation is for each frame, independently of the previous. 
3. Observe when variance is high in the video of real time working of the system.
