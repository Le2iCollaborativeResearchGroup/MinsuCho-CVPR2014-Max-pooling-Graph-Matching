# Graphical Abstract

---------------------------

1. Problem: feature matching using graph structure
	- Graph construction: features (graph nodes), connections (graph edges), distances (graph weights).
	- Affinity between graph nodes.
	- Affinity between graph edges.
	- Optimization of quadratic form.

2. Motivation:
	- Feature matching considering both local and global information.
	- Robust to outliers by considering geometric structures.

3. Algorithms:
	- Max-pooling.
	- Reweighted Random Walk.
	- Fractorization.

4. Application:
	- feature matching	
	- object recognition
